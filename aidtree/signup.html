                    <p>By entering your email you agree to receive Aidtree e-mails that inform you of correspondence that supports your cause ("Tree"). You may unsubscribe at anytime.</p>
                    <p>Welcome to the Aidtree Site (defined below). By using it, you are agreeing to these Terms of Use (defined below). Please read them carefully. If you have any questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:questions@aidtree.com">questions@aidtree.com</a></p>
                    <p>These Terms of Use were last updated on Dec 13, 2016.</p>
                    <h3>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS OF USE</h3>
                    <p>Aidtree, Inc. (“Aidtree” "we" or “us” or “our”) owns and operates the website, www.Aidtree.com, the mobile and touch versions and any sites we have now or in the future that reference these Terms of Use (collectively, "Site"). By using the Site and Aidtree’s services through the Site, you agree to these Terms of Use (defined below) and any additional terms applicable to certain programs in which you may elect to participate. You also agree to our Privacy Statement, located at http://www.Aidtree.com/privacy, and acknowledge that you will regularly visit the Terms of Use (defined below) to familiarize yourself with any updates. The Privacy Statement, together with these terms of use, and any other terms contained herein or incorporated herein by reference, are collectively referred to as the "Terms of Use." The term "using" also includes any person or entity that accesses or uses the Site with crawlers, robots, data mining or extraction tools or any other functionality.</p>
                    <p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE, IMMEDIATELY STOP USING THE SITE AND DO NOT USE ANY AIDTREE SERVICE, PARTICIPATE IN ANY PROGRAM OR PURCHASE ANY DISCOUNT GIFT CARD, PRODUCT OR OTHER GOOD OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH THE SITE.</p>
                    <h2>1. About the Site</h2>
                    <p>The Site is a crowd-funding platform through which certain merchants (“Merchants”) make available rebate/discount gift card offerings (“Rebate/Discount Gift Cards”) (collectively, “Merchant Offerings”). Merchants are the issuers of Rebate/Discount Gift Cards. The Merchant is solely responsible to you for the care and quality of the goods and services it provides. The Merchants will create the Rebate/Discount Gift Cards support specific Causes (“Trees”) which will coincide with the User. These Rebate/Discount Gift Cards are purchased by the User on the Aidtree website at a 50% discount with 90% of the Rebate/Discount Gift Card purchase price, post-processing fees, going to a Cause (“Tree”) previously created on the site. 10% of the purchase price, pre-processing, goes to the Site. Processing fees currently consist of using the billing payment system Braintree only. Additional tools on the site include a Comments/Photo posting section and a User philanthropic performance reporter.</p>
                    <p>All Merchant Offerings, Products, other available programs, pricing and payment processing methods on the Site may change at any time in Aidtree’s discretion, without notice.</p>
                    <h2>2. Ownership of the Site</h2>
                    <p>The Site, any content on the Site and the infrastructure used to provide the Site are proprietary to us, our affiliates, Merchants and other content providers. By using the Site and accepting these Terms of Use: (a) Aidtree grants you a limited, personal, nontransferable, nonexclusive, revocable license to use the Site pursuant to these Terms of Use and to any additional terms and policies set forth by Aidtree; and (b) you agree not to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works from, publicly display, publicly perform, license, sell or re-sell any content, software, products or services obtained from or through the Site without the express permission of Aidtree.</p>
                    <h2>3. Use of the Site</h2>
                    <p>As a condition of your use of the Site, you agree that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>You are at least 14 years of age;</li>

                            <li>You will only make Rebate/Discount Gift Card purchases on the Site to go toward Merchant purchases for your own use and enjoyment while at the same time supporting a Tree financially;</li>
                            <li>You have the right to provide any and all information you submit to the Site, the information and all such information is accurate, true, current and complete;</li>
                            <li>You will update and correct information you have submitted to the Site and ensure that it is accurate at all times (out-of-date information will invalidate your account); and,</li>
                            <li>You will only purchase a Rebate/Discount Gift Card by creating an account on the Site, and any purchase will be subject to the applicable Terms of Sale set forth in these Terms of Use;</li>
                            <li>You will understand the Merchant can modify the Rebate/Discount Gift Card at any time for any reason. The only requirement is that the Rebate/Discount Gift Card purchased prior to the modification be honored;</li>
                            <li>You will not use any commentary that is construed by the Site as cyber-bullying, sexually suggestive/foul language, with complaints by other users and confirmation about such activity constituting a warning. Subsequent activity will have the user banned from the Site.</li>
                            <li>You will not post any nudity/pornography pictures/video on the comment/pictures section of the Site. The Site reserves the right to remove such landingimages/files.</li>
                            <li>You are welcome to improve the business reach of your Tree by handing Coupon Seeds to Merchants you frequent. You will honor the response of the Merchant and respect the Merchant if there is a request for No Solicitation.</li>
                            <li>You are to understand that Aidtree will do its’ best effort to validate all Trees to ensure authenticity as mentioned under these Terms of Use. It is unfortunately inevitable that a fraudulent Tree will attempt to raise money. Please inform Aidtree of the questionable Tree here and Aidtree will investigate the validity of your claim. Refunds will not be given for Rebate/Discount Gift Cards purchased and used on behalf of fraudulent Trees.</li>
                            <li>You are to understand that any Rebate/Discount Gift Cards not used in 30 days from purchased will be refunded to the purchaser. If one coupon of a Multiple-Coupon offer is used the balance of the coupons will not be refunded.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2>4. Access to the Site</h2>
                    <p>Aidtree retains the right, at our sole discretion, to deny service or use of the Site or an account to anyone at any time and for any reason. While we use reasonable efforts to keep the Site and your account accessible, the Site and/or your account may be unavailable from time to time. You understand and agree that there may be interruptions in service or events, Site access or access to your account due to circumstances both within our control (e.g., routine maintenance) and outside of our control.</p>
                    <h2>5. Modification</h2>
                    <p>We reserve the right at all times to discontinue or modify any part of these Terms of Use in our sole discretion. If we make changes that affect your use of the Site or our services we will post notice of the change on the Terms of Use page. Any changes to these Terms of Use will be effective upon our posting of the notice; provided that these changes will not apply to Merchant Offerings or Products purchased prior to the effective date of such changes. If you do not agree to the changes, you may close your account and you should not use the Site or any services offered through the Site after the effective date of the changes. We suggest that you revisit our Terms of Use regularly to ensure that you stay informed of any changes. You agree that posting notice of any changes on the Terms of Use page is adequate notice to advise you of these changes, and that your continued use of the Site or our services will constitute acceptance of these changes and the Terms of Use as modified.</p>
                    <h2>6. Your Account</h2>
                    <p>You may only create and hold one account on the Site for your personal use and must register using your real name. The User can also create an Alias that allows them to not show their real name publicly. The actual name will only be shown to their personal network and the Tree Administrator under a monitored Contribution Leader Board. You are responsible for updating and correcting information you have submitted to create or maintain your account. As part of your account settings, you have the option to: (a) save, edit or delete your personal information, including, without limitation, payment data; and (b) opt-out of persistent login.

We will assume that anyone using the Site or transacting through your account is you. You agree that you are solely responsible for any activity that occurs under your account. Your account will expire and you will lose any promotional benefits earned through a Promotional Activity (if held) if your account is not maintained with current information.</p>
                    <p>Your account is non-transferrable. You cannot sell, combine, or otherwise share it with any other person. Any violation of these Terms of Use, including failure to maintain updated and correct information about your account, will cause your account to fall out of good standing and we may cancel your account in our sole discretion. If your account is cancelled, you may forfeit any pending, current or future promotional account credits and any other forms of unredeemed value in your account. Upon termination, the provisions of these Terms of Use that are by their nature intended to survive termination (e.g., any disclaimers, all limitations of liability and all indemnities) shall survive. We also reserve the right to change or discontinue any aspect or feature of our services or the Site, including, but not limited to, requirements for use.</p>
                    <p>The Tree Administrator will have the option of creating a Contribution Leader Board for affiliated Tree Users to get credit for their philanthropy.</p>

By virtue of this Agreement (defined below), you and Aidtree are each giving up the right to go to court and have a Dispute heard by a judge or jury (except as otherwise set forth in this Section 24(a) or Section 24(d)). The provisions of this Section 24 shall constitute your and Aidtree’s written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act (“Agreement”). Any modification to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by you and Aidtree. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, available at http://www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879. The arbitrator will apply and be bound by this Agreement, apply applicable law and the facts, and issue a reasoned award.
                        <br />To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must comply with the limitations provision set forth in Section 24(e) and submit the Dispute by utilizing the forms available at http://www.adr.org. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. Aidtree will reimburse those fees for Disputes totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous. Likewise, Aidtree will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous. The arbitration will be conducted based upon written submissions unless you request and/or the arbitrator determines that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. If the arbitrator grants the request or determines an in-person hearing is necessary, the hearing will proceed in San Bernardino County, California, unless the arbitrator determines or we agree that the matter should proceed in the county in which you reside.
                        <br /><span b="">No Class Action Matters.</span>We each agree that we shall bring any Dispute against the other in our respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association. In addition, we each agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.
                        <br />
                    </p>
